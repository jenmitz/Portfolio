# Portfolio #
**Basics**
This is a small personal webpage, in development to become a personal professional site. It originally started as a basic HTML and CSS site, but I've now added Bootstrap.


**Current features**
- Design: I've gone for a classy look with cream-colored leather and shades of brown. 
- Elements: There are links that take you to other parts of the site in a navbar. 
- Pages: This site has 3 main pages, and they are a landing page (about me), a contact page, and a portfolio page that showcases and gives links to my projects.


**Planned changes**
- Icons that link to GitHub and LinkedIn
- Functioning contact page (implement JavaScript)
- Finished portfolio page with proper formatting
- Implement media queries to really make sure that sizing is good to go across different screens
