                Hello! I'm an upcoming web developer out of Sacramento, and this is my first website. 
                It was made with frustration, time, and gusto... and perhaps even magic, because 
                even I don't even know why/how some of this works. I am just starting, so don't hold it against me.
                <br><br>
                (Disclaimer: I don't practice magic.)
                <br><br>
                When I'm not coding,
                you'll likely find me playing an excessive amount of video games, playing board games, or spending time with friends - sometimes all at once.
                 Fun facts: 
                I play/have played over 10 musical instruments, have an unhealthy obsession with sloths, and have ridden two camels.
                <br><br>
                Feel free to follow me on Twitter @jenmitz or connect with me on LinkedIn. (Hey, by the way, those links up top? They work!! 
                (It's pretty exciting if you ask me.) 
                <br><br>
                <em><strong>[note: this is not intended to be a serious & professional bio. it's more for 
                fun, but i'll make an actual bio soon.]</strong></em>
