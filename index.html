                Hello! This is my first website, and I made it with love, frustration, effort, and some third-party type of magic. It had to be magic. I don't even know why all of this works. I'm a beginner, okay?<br><br>I've just started my coding journey from my residence in Sacramento, CA. When I'm not coding, I'm likely playing video games and/or spending time with my fiance. I have a three-legged dog named Lincoln, have played over 10 musical instruments, and have ridden two camels.<br><br>Feel free to follow me on my learning journey here, though I'm not sure I'd recommend it! (Hey, by the way, those links up top? They work!!)
